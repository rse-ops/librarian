![img/rse-ops-librarian.png](img/rse-ops-librarian.png)

The librarian (inspired by the [autamus librarian](https://github.com/autamus/librarian)
is a set of GitHub actions intended to be used to update different RSE-ops projects.

 - [docker-images](docker-images): this librarian creates a metadata entry for a Docker container in [docker-images](https://github.com/rse-ops/docker-images)
 - [readthedocs](readthedocs): makes it easy to deploy a readthedocs (e.g., sphinx template) to GitHub pages
